# Minimalistic-ToDo™
New Update:
Minimalistic-ToDo™ is now touch-friendly and has a cleaner interface and UI. But this still doesn't mean it will work on all mobile browsers, like Safari. If the browser doesn't work, install the .exe for iOS Devices.

Minimalistic-ToDo™ is a simple and clean utility to add, clear, and manage tasks in one desktop app.

Features:

You can add tasks.

You can clear tasks.

You can create a deadline that sends a notification reminder (only available in the web application).

Works simply and cleanly in both desktop applications and web applications.

Desktop app:

You can download the folder from my Github repository:
https://github.com/RayStormz2015/Minimalistic-ToDo

IMPORTANT: The desktop app does NOT support notifications.

To receive notifications, use the web version.

Web application:

You can go to this site:
https://raystormz2015.github.io/To-do-List/

IMPORTANT: The web version is not touch-friendly for some browsers

And also, creating a desktop shortcut for the application is recommended, since not creating a desktop shortcut means you have to download the application from the installer again to run it.
